# Narrative A: Linear Causality

The claim that algorithmic recommendation engines on social media are the *primary cause* of political polarization exemplifies a linear causal model. In this view, algorithms (A) directly produce polarization (B). This narrative dominates public discourse because it aligns with our intuitive, everyday understanding of causality—a straightforward chain where one event leads predictably to another.

Language plays a crucial role in reinforcing this linearity. We speak of algorithms “driving” polarization, “creating” echo chambers, or “leading to” ideological extremism. These verbal constructions imply a clear, unidirectional flow of influence from technology to society. They assign agency to the algorithm, treating it as an independent actor that operates on a passive user base. Such language simplifies a complex socio‑technical system into a digestible story of blame and solution: fix the algorithms, and you fix polarization.

This simplification, however, comes at a cost. By framing the relationship as a linear cause‑and‑effect, we obscure the recursive, feedback‑driven nature of the phenomenon. Algorithms are not exogenous forces; they are trained on data generated by human behavior. The polarization they appear to “cause” is already present in the social fabric—the algorithms merely amplify what they have learned. Yet the linear narrative, with its clear villain and straightforward remedy, is politically potent and media‑friendly. It fuels calls for regulatory intervention and technical fixes that target the algorithm alone, while leaving the underlying social divisions unaddressed.

Ultimately, the linear model is a linguistic and conceptual shortcut. It makes the problem seem manageable by isolating a single cause, but in doing so it risks misdiagnosing the root of polarization. When we say “algorithms cause polarization,” we are using language to carve out a tidy causal slice from a messy, circular reality. That tidiness can itself become a source of misinformation, because it invites us to believe that changing one variable will break the cycle, when in fact the cycle is sustained by mutually reinforcing factors that no linear intervention can fully disentangle.
