# Narrative B: Circular Causality

The relationship between social media algorithms and political polarization is not a linear chain but a recursive loop—a classic example of circular causality. Pre‑existing social divisions (A) generate polarizing content, which trains the algorithms (B); those algorithms then amplify the very divisions that shaped them (A), creating a self‑reinforcing feedback cycle. This model rejects the simplistic “algorithm as independent cause” narrative and instead highlights the co‑evolution of technology and society.

Language that embraces circularity—terms like “reinforces,” “feeds back into,” “shapes and is shaped by”—captures the mutual constitution of the technical and the social. Algorithms do not operate in a vacuum; they are trained on historical data that already reflects societal biases, political fractures, and affective polarization. The output of an algorithm is therefore a reflection of the society that produced the training data, which in turn influences future social behavior, which then generates new training data, and so on. This is not a bug but a fundamental feature of machine‑learning systems embedded in human culture.

The linear narrative’s linguistic simplicity, while appealing, can itself become a source of “fake news” or misinformation. By isolating the algorithm as the primary cause, it directs attention toward technical fixes (e.g., tweaking recommendation weights) while obscuring the deeper social and political roots of polarization. This oversimplification breeds a false sense of control: if we just change the algorithm, the problem will vanish. In reality, the circular dynamics mean that any intervention aimed solely at the algorithmic layer will likely be absorbed, adapted, or even subverted by the underlying social forces that sustain the loop.

Circular causality demands a more humble and holistic approach. It recognizes that polarization is a systemic phenomenon, produced by the interplay of human psychology, group identity, economic incentives, media ecosystems, and algorithmic amplification. Breaking the cycle requires interventions at multiple points—social, political, economic, and technical—because each element both influences and is influenced by the others. To understand polarization, we must think in loops, not lines.
