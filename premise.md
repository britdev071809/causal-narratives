# Project Premise: Defining the Competing Narratives

## Competing Causal Narratives

This document defines the two opposing viewpoints that will be modeled in this repository.

### Narrative A (Linear Causality)
**Claim:** Social media algorithms (A) directly cause increased political polarization (B).

**Key characteristics:**
- Unidirectional cause‑and‑effect
- Algorithms are treated as independent actors
- Language of direct causation: “leads to,” “creates,” “drives”
- Focus on technological determinism

### Narrative B (Circular Causality)
**Claim:** Pre‑existing social divisions (A) lead to the creation and adoption of polarizing content, which in turn shapes the algorithms (B), which then further amplify the divisions (A), creating a feedback loop.

**Key characteristics:**
- Mutual reinforcement and feedback loops
- Co‑evolution of technology and society
- Language of recursion: “reinforces,” “feeds back into,” “shapes and is shaped by”
- Emphasis on socio‑technical entanglement
